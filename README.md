# Titanium Angular Platform

> Build cross-platform apps using Titanium and Angular

## Introduction

Adds a new platform to Angular allowing you to easily create native mobile apps with Axway Appcelerator Titanium.

> ⚠️ This platform is currently in an early alpha stage. Expect things to be broken or APIs to change as this project matures. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!

## Getting started

You can checkout how Titanium Angular works by taking a look at the bundled example application. To get started, first prepare all bundled packages by installing their dependencies with `sh prepare.sh`. After that, go to the example project in `ti-angular-example`. You can now build and run the app with `appc run -p [android|ios]`.

> ⚠️ The example app currently only runs on Android and iOS and requires the latest SDK from our master branch. You can install the latest master build via `appc ti sdk install -b master`.
